# Rock-paper-scissor-basic-CNN-
I learnt the neural networks ,and i thought of doing my first basic project related to this,and i did it.It took a lot of effort and hardwork,cannot able to upload every file because it took too much space
# Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:
Open the .ipynb notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

Use the model to predict the outcome of a rock-paper-scissors game by inputting your choices as a list of integers (e.g. [1, 2, 3] for rock-paper-scissors).
